# rnn-chopin-music-generation

## Model
Generating music using a __Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with LSTM and dense layers__, implemented in Tensorflow/Keras and trained on 10 pieces of Frédéric Chopin's Waltz/Valse pieces and 9 pieces of Chopin's Nocturne pieces separately.

## Dataset
* 10 Valse/Waltz pieces in MIDI: [kunstderfuge.com](kunstderfuge.com)
* 9 Nocturne pieces in MIDI: [8notes.com](8notes.com)

## Listen to generated sample
[Listen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15_iUzKmi_8AfiSeuUitjohxkX-sYhoJz/view?usp=sharing) to one of the waltz music generated by the model.
